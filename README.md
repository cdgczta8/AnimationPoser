# AnimationPoser

This is the code for the Virt-A-Mate AnimationPoser plugin.

This is a fork of MacGruber's IdlePoser.

I strongly encourage plugin developers to pick it up! It's a new paradigm for animation. It's capabilities can be extended to the infinity, in many different directions. The most important thing is the paradigm: multiple animations, with multiple layers, with multiple states forming a MarkovChain. After a lot of thought, I found this is the best framework for animation for most uses in VAM. In the future, a timeline could be added under a state, so that a state becomes a moving timeline, and then randomly transitions to another state.
